Once you install it to clone the repository click

"Check out from Version Control"

Choose the correct Git repository (Should be called "CS-2820-Amazon-Warehouse-B4" )


When it asks you to create an IDEA project click yes

Click next on everything up to "Please select project SDK"

In this if there is nothing click on the + and add Java JDK
	
	NOTE: On windows for some odd reason you must click the jdk in Program Files directory (not X86)
		Make sure you select 1.8


Then click next and finish.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once the main screen opens up go to File --> Project Structure

From this menu select the Projects tab on the left

Make sure the Project SDK is 1.8 (Should be since we added this already, if not click on new and find the JDK directory in the Program Files directory)

Make sure Project Language Level is set to "SDK Default (8)" or "8 - Lambdas, type annotations, etc.."



Now select the Modules tab on the left

Go to sources tab (Should be already there)
	Make sure src is set to Sources and tst is set to Tests (Should be automatically set up)
	

Now click on the Paths tab (Right next to Sources)
	Make sure "Exclude output paths" is selected (Should be by default)


Apply your changes and click ok.
